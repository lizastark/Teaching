# Touch Sensing 

There are a few different options for sensing human touch:
- Capacitive sensing with the [CapSense Library](https://playground.arduino.cc/Main/CapacitiveSensor/) for Arduino
- Using the touch pins on a Teensy ([here is a decent explanation](http://little-scale.blogspot.com/2017/05/teensy-36-basics-touchread.html))
- Capacitive sensor breakout [like this one from Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1982)
- Using a high value resistor to trigger human conductance (see the sketch in this folder)
