  LIZA NOTES
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  *** This should be used to test different commands for the DFPlayer Mini.
  *** I have found the available libraries to be woefully inadequate and that it is much
      easier to use ten byte commands to perform tasks with this component.
  *** Unfortunately, the original posting where Ype Brada posted this sketch and tutorial
      has been removed.
  *** Follow the instructions below (after Liza Notes) to discover different commands
  *** Once you send a command, the program will print out the checksum high and low so you
      can use the command in an array in another program

  (1) Data Sheet
  ===========================
  There is a LOT of information here about specific commands, specifically related to file
  structures and naming which are important!
  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FWj6h1n_1OTdEhtpa7ombmwNBnde4SYm/view

  (2) Playing a file
  ===========================
  - Specify folder and file to playback (15 / 0x0F) is the most efficient way to play a file
        - Command = 15
        - Command Feedback = X
        - Parameter 1 (DH) = Folder # (two digits)
        - Parameter 2 (DL) = File # (three digits)
  - Name all files using three digits: 001, 002, 003, etc
  - Put them inside a folder(s) named with two digits: 01, 02, 03, etc
  - Run this program and type in the command, parameter 1, and parameter 2.
  - For example, to play the 5th song inside the first folder, you would type in:
        15,01,005

  (3) Getting the CheckSums
  ===========================
  - Open the serial monitor and enter the command
  - Once it has received the command, the serial monitor will output the hex values for
    checksum high and checksum low
  - You can now input these in the 7th and 8th positions (counting from 0 at the beginning)
    in the byte array to use in another program

  BACK TO ORIGINAL NOTES
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Program is meant to discover all the possibilities of the command
  structure of the DFPlayer mini. No special libraries are needed.

  In general, there are 3 ways to address a MP3 or WAV file:
  (1) Track order:
    All songs are stored a certain order on the card. The order is however
    not garanteed and very depending on the order how the files were written to the card. This
    method is not suitable when it is absolutly neccessary that a specific track is played. Commands
    using this written order are (0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x08, 0x11, 0x3C, 0x3D, 0x3E, 0x4B, 0x4C, 0x4D).
    The name of a song is arbitrary.
  (2) Folder number and song number:
    Folders are named 01~99 and songs 001~255.mp3 or 001~255.WAV. It's possible to exactly address
    a specific song with command 0x0F. Command 0x17 is related.  When adressing a specific file,
    the file is always internaly converted to the stored track number. This number can be requested by
    commands  0x4B, 0x4C or 0x4D.
  (3) Folder named "mp3" and song number:
    A folder is named "mp3" and songs with a name of exact a 4-digit number (0001~2999) e.g. 0235.mp3.
    It's possible to exactly address a specific song with command 0x12.The according track number can
    be requested by commands 0x4B, 0x4C or 0x4D.

  This program is simple and can be the basis for your own mp3 player sketch.
  Note: The DF Player commands are not always correct described in the manual. I tried to fix it, but
  there is still a something to do. The commands recoverd so far are listed below.

  How to use this sketch:
  Enter three (separated) DECIMAL numbers in the Serial Monitor with no end of line character.
  First number : Command
  Second number: First (High Byte) parameter
  Third number : Second (Low Byte) parameter
  E.g.: 3,0,1 will play the first track on the TF card

  VERY IMPORTANT: Use serial 1K resistors or a level shifter between module RX and TX
  and Arduino to suppress audio noise
  Connect Sound module board RX to Arduino pin 11 (via 1K resistor)
  Connect Sound module board TX to Arduino pin 10 (via 1K resistor)
  Connect Sound module board Vcc to Arduino Vin when powered via USB (preferably 3.0)
  else use seperate 5V power supply
  Connect Sound module board GND to Arduino GND


  General DF Player mini command structure (only byte 3, 5 and 6 to be entered in the serial monitor):
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Byte Function         Value
  ==== ================ ====
  (0)  Start Byte       0x7E
  (1)  Version Info     0xFF  (don't know why it's called Version Info)
  (2)  Number of bytes  0x06  (Always 6 bytes)
  (3)  Command          0x__
  (4)  Command feedback 0x__  If enabled returns info with command 0x41 [0x01: info, 0x00: no info]
  (5)  Parameter 1 [DH] 0x__
  (6)  Parameter 2 [DL] 0x__
  (7)  Checksum high    0x__ See explanation below. Is calculated in function: execute_CMD
  (8)  Checksum low     0x__ See explanation below. Is calculated in function: execute_CMD
  (9)  End command      0xEF

  Checksum calculation.
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Checksum =  -Sum(byte(1..6)) (2 bytes, notice minus sign!)
